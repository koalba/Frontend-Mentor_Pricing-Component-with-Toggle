### What I learned

While doing this challenge, I tried to give a bit more atention to the animations in it. I think the most challengin one was how to show the change between the different prices, I strugle deciding what I would do and tried a lot of different things. In the end this idea came to my mind and I'm really proud of how it turned out! I don't know if there is a better way to do it than this, but I think it works pretty nicely!

### Continued development

I want to keep focusing in little animations that bring more happiness to a web, while improving my JQuery skills in the meantime. I'm still a bit scaerd to take harder challenges, but I hope little by little I'll be ready soon!
